When you start to work on this:

- in console run: 


// if you're just joining the project, try
renv::restore()


//only first time (try first without this)
renv::init() 
then pick 'reactivate (2)'

//but probably you do just this
renv::rebuild()

//?renv::activate()

- then in R studio use the button Render.
